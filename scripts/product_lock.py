"""Maintain and consume the reviewed Linux product dependency lock.

The engine and helpcode pins are gitlinks. Git already makes those immutable and shows every move in a pull request diff, so they are not copied into this lock: doing that would only give the submodule pin a second home to drift from, and it would break the dependabot bump that engine-bump-triage.yml merges on green CI.

The dictionary the packages actually *ship* is the one input git does not pin. It is a release asset behind a tag that upstream can retag, and it used to be verified against the SHA256SUMS.txt published beside it, which is exactly as mutable as the data. So product-lock.json holds the tag and the SHA256 of every asset, and the build verifies those committed digests instead.

The dictionary's *source* commit is locked alongside them rather than read from a gitlink. It used to be a gitlink, and that pin recorded the wrong answer: nothing moved it in lockstep with the release tag, so the manifest attested to whatever revision of MSIME-Dict happened to be vendored while the packages shipped bytes built from a different one. The commit the release tag resolves to is the only one that produced the data, so `refresh` resolves it at the moment the data is reviewed and commits it here.

`refresh` is the only command that reaches upstream. `manifest` records what a build consumed: the source commit, every gitlink, the locked dictionary and the digest of the lock itself.
